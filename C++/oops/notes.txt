----------C with Classes -- Advanced Structure -- to overcome limitations of structure in C -- OOp's features in C++ ----------
------ scope of DM's in CPP --------
1.private -- within class
2.protected -- within class -- immediate child class can access
3.public -- can be access everywhere
by default if scope not given then it is considered as private.

 -- Pure Encapsulation -- make DM private and MF public to maintain Data security (object k thrgh Dm ko bahar se access nahi kar sakte, app MF k thrgh DM ko access karoghe).
